Welcome! My name is Jiayi and I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Boston University. I am advised by Professor [Alex Green](https://www.alexgreenlab.org/). My research focuses on engineering RNA-based genetic devices through computational design and high-throughput screening. In particular, I am interested in applying machine learning algorithm to generate controllable RNA sensors for disease detection and cell regulation.
